# Farm Pass

A simple, responsive static website for the Farm Pass app idea.  
This repo provides a quick “launch pad” you can host (e.g. via GitHub Pages) while you build out the full backend.

## 🚀 Features

- **Hero section** with branding and call-to-action buttons  
- **“How It Works”** overview with icons and copy  
- **Dual sign-up forms**  
  - Families (waitlist)  
  - Farm owners (signup interest)  
- **Responsive layout** powered by Bootstrap 5  
- **Custom CSS** for branding and hero background  
- **Lightweight JS** handlers for form submissions (placeholder alerts)  

## 🗂️ File Structure

```
├── index.html       ← landing page markup  
├── styles.css       ← custom styles  
└── script.js        ← form handlers (stubbed)  
```

## ⚙️ Setup & Deployment

1. **Fork or clone** this repo.  
2. (Optional) Edit the files directly in the GitHub web editor on your iPad.  
3. In your repo’s **Settings → Pages**, select the `main` branch as the source.  
4. Wait a minute, then visit:
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
   ```

## 🔧 Next Steps

- Replace the placeholder `alert()` calls in `script.js` with real `fetch()` POSTs to your backend or serverless endpoints.  
- Hook up a form-processing service (e.g. Firebase Functions, AWS Lambda) to capture waitlist and signup data.  
- Swap the hero image URL in `styles.css` for your own photography or branded asset.  
- Add SEO meta tags, favicon, and analytics snippet.  
- Extend to a multi-page prototype or integrate with your React/React Native codebase when ready.
